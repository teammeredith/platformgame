Introduction
------------

It's a platform game.  The first 10 levels or so introduce the mechanics and 
concepts: buttons, lifts, springs etc.  They aren't intended to very challenging.
After that it gets more interesting and the idea is that the levels require some 
thought to solve.   

There's also a level designer to make it easy to create new levels.  One of the 
reasons I wrote the game was so that the kids could design new levels.  
A number of the levels were designed by them :-)

Dependencies
------------

The game requires Python 3 and is dependent upon pygame.  `pip install pygame`
It's only been tested on Windows, and briefly on a MacBook.  It's written in 
Python so requires a reasonably fast laptop to run smoothly.

Running the game
----------------

To run the game:
- `python myplatformgame.py`

To start at a later level add a level number.  E.g. to start at level 4 (bearing 
in mind the first level is level 0 of course)
- `python myplatformgame.py 4`

Controls
--------

- Left arrow: move Left
- Right arrow: move Right
- Space bar: jump
- Escape: restart the level
- n: skip to the next level
- q: quit

Scene designer
--------------

`python scenedesigner.py <scene file name>`

This will edit or create a new scene in the scenes directory.  Running
`python scenedesigner.py 0.json` will create a new scene file "scenes\0.json".
The game runs scenes in alphabetical order from the scenes directory, so "0.json" 
is a good scene name for testing.

In the scene designer...
- Select a tile from the right hand side and left click in the grid to place it.
- Hold shift and left click in the grid to place it rotated
- Right click in the grid to clear a tile
- Optionally place the little man somewhere to specify where the player should start
- Click "Done" when you're done to save your changes.  (or "q" to quit without saving)
